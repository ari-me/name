<!--First Tip-->
<div class="tips_tricks" id="tip-1" style="background-color:rgb(235, 207, 141,0.3);">
	<div class="tips_text" style="float:left;">
		<h3>01</h3>
		<h4 class="visible">Clean Knives and Surfaces</h4><br>
		<p class="visible">For safe food preparation, don't cut raw meat, poultry or fish 
		on the same surface or with the same knife without cleaning it thoroughly between uses. 
		Wash your knife and cutting board with soap and hot water, or change the knife or board after each use.</p>

<!--Second Tip-->
<div class="tips_tricks" style="background-color:rgb(190, 208, 164,0.6);">
	<div class="tips_text" style="float:right;">
		<h3>02</h3>
		<h4 class="visible">Stop boiling water from overflowing</h4><br>
		<p class="visible">Place a wooden spoon lengthwise on top of the pot, and the water will not boil over. 
		This works because the wood acts as a water repellant for the bubbles which stops it from rising, 
		and the spoon being of a cooler temperature that when the bubbles meet the spoon, it condenses back into water.</p>

<!--Third Tip-->
<div class="tips_tricks" style="background-color:rgb(235, 207, 141,0.3);">
	<div class="tips_text" style="float:left;">
		<h3>03</h3>
		<h4 class="visible">Read the whole recipe before starting</h4><br>
		<p class="visible">It seems like common sense but is actually forgotten a lot.
		It's important to read the whole recipe from ingredients to the cooking process so that you know
		the basic structure and how it's made. It also helps if there are ingredients divided into portions that aren't
		shown in the ingredients section.</p>

<!--Fourth Tip-->
<div class="tips_tricks" style="background-color:rgb(190, 208, 164,0.6);">
	<div class="tips_text" style="float:right;">
		<h3>04</h3>
		<h4 class="visible">Honey! Honey! Honey!</h4><br>
		<p class="visible">Honey is a part of your ingredients and it's sticking to your measuring materials? Well, try coating the
		measuring spoon or cup with a teaspoon of oil before putting in the honey. It should slide right out! <br> Crystalized honey?
		place the container in a bowl of hot water until the honey is smooth again. Alternatively, you could remove the lid and microwave 
		the jar in 30-second intervals.</p>

<!--Fifth Tip-->
<div class="tips_tricks" id="tip-5" style="background-color:rgb(235, 207, 141,0.3);">
	<div class="tips_text" style="float:left;">
		<h3>05</h3>
		<h4 class="visible">Season and taste your Food!</h4><br>
		<p class="visible">Once salt and/or pepper has been added to your dish, taste it â€” if it tastes bland or lacks flavor, season it more and taste again. 
		To prevent oversalting your dishes, use a little bit at a time as a start. <br>When dealing with other meals as well, season each part.
		For instance, when frying breaded chicken, season not only your chicken, but the eggs, flour, and breadcrumbs too! Season your noodles as it boils!
		Season it all!</p>

<!--Sixth Tip-->
<div class="tips_tricks" style="background-color:rgb(190, 208, 164,0.6);">
	<div class="tips_text" style="float:right;">
		<h3>06</h3>
		<h4 class="visible">Is your pan hot enough for cooking?</h4><br>
		<p class="visible">Check if your pot is ready for cooking with the water test! Heat up your pan as usual and add 
		a bit of water to the pan. If the water sits in the pan it's not yet ready. If it sizzles and evaporates immediately, it's too hot. If 
		it disperses into tiny beads of water forming into one ball that roll around the bottom of the pan, it's ready and you can wait for the water to evaporate then add your oil.</p>

<!--Seventh Tip-->
<div class="tips_tricks" style="background-color:rgb(235, 207, 141,0.3);">
	<div class="tips_text" style="float:left;">
		<h3>07</h3>
		<h4 class="visible">Peeling Boiled Eggs</h4><br>
		<p class="visible">There are many tricks to getting the perfect boiled eggs. But there is one trick that worked the most for me. 
		Before boiling your eggs, lightly tap the egg with a spoon until you hear a crack sound. That shows that the membrane of your egg is cracked giving more space when you open it.
		When transferring your boiled eggs, crack them while it's in cold water, give it some time, and then hit it and peel as usual. Take note that despite it being easier,
		it may still take some time to get used to and not all eggs have to be perfect :)</p>

<!--Eigth Tip-->

	<div class="tips_text" style="float:right;">
		<h3>08</h3>
		<h4 class="visible">Softening Butter</h4><br>
		<p class="visible">Forgot to take butter out of the refrigerator in advance?I know 3 ways to soften it quick!
		<br><b>1</b> Get a cup big enough to hold the stick of butter. Put boiling water into that cup. After a few minutes, drain the water. Cover the butter with the cup, the heat from the hot water will soften the butter.
		<br><b>2</b> Cut the sticks into pieces and set out on a counter. In 10 to 15 minutes, you'll be good to go.
		<br><b>3</b> Micorwave the cut pieces on low in 20-second intervals until it's malleable (not mushy).</p>

<!--Ninth Tip-->
<div class="tips_tricks" id="tip-9" style="background-color:rgb(235, 207, 141,0.3);">
	<div class="tips_text" style="float:left;">
		<h3>09</h3>
		<h4 class="visible">Cutting Bell Peppers</h4><br>
		<p class="visible">It's bothersome when bell pepper seeds get everywhere while cutting don't they? Well, try flipping the bell pepper stem side down 
		and cut the bell pepper by the lines. Peel those parts from the stem, and there you got the bell peppers away from the seeds easily.</p>

<!--Tenth Tip-->
<div class="tips_tricks" style="background-color:rgb(190, 208, 164,0.6);">
	<div class="tips_text" style="float:right;">
		<h3>10</h3>
		<h4 class="visible">Keeping Deep Fried Food Crispy</h4><br>
		<p class="visible">Have you fried something to crispy perfection, only to find later that they've turned soggy? 
		The residual heat of fried food becomes trapped under the food and creates steam, transforming crispy to crummy.
		Instead of a plate, put your freshly fried food on a cooling rack with a baking sheet on the bottom to collect the dripping oil. 
		With room for air to circulate, fried morsels maintain their satisfying crunch until dinner.</p>
